PYSheets is a utility that allows the creation and copying of templates using the GoogleSheets API

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed Python3.8 (I used 3.8.5 in dev)
* You're going to need a few libraries and honestly you're going to want to read the docs. [Info here](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/quickstart/python) 


## Using PySheets

You're going to want to follow that quick start guide linked above before messing with the API
<br>
After reading up on the API and quick start guide:
- run quickstart.py to test and generate credentials to use
- create_sheet.py has been edited from what's seen in the quickstart to allow you to enter a name for your sheet
- after creating that sheet, do whatever edits you need or skip to copy_template.py if you're copying a template to that new sheet
- Further info found in the [docs](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/quickstart/python)
